make sure that you examine the seed before planting it it will have a hole on the top
this is where the plant will emerge from and it is also the breathing hole of the seed
make sure to choose the best quality seeds you can find and also make sure they can adapt perfectly to
the surounding of your house,farm,lawn etc because if we arent carefull about this then manitaning the plant will
become a hard job to do.
